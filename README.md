#### Project 1 💬🎲

## Random Quote Generator

###### This is the first of twelve projects for the 🏡 Treehouse Techdegree Full Stack JavaScript.


👩‍💻  I've aimed for Exceeds Expectations by expanding the project as follows:

- Added a `tags` property to categorise quotes.
- When the quote changes, the background colour of the page randomly changes.
- A quote is only displayed once, until all of the quotes in the array have been displayed. Check the console to see the logs for this by clicking 'Show another quote'.
- The quote auto refreshes every 30 seconds, showing a new quote.
- Tested on Chrome, Safari.
